# Cryo-Bomb
Cryo-Bomb, a Minecraft Data Pack.  Create a super cold blast!  Cool lava and freeze water!

### How to Use:
Place a Blue Ice block on a Magma Block and it will create a Cryo-Bomb, the blast will turn nearby water/lava to its solid form.  
Standing to close may hurt.

(I just improved the pack for my purposes and made it multipurpose.)
