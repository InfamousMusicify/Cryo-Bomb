# [Cryo-Bomb ðŸŽ¥](https://youtu.be/pgQl1X-ksjs)
Cryo-Bomb, a Minecraft Data Pack.  Create a super cold blast!  Cool lava and freeze water!

#### Tested in 1.16.4
Probably works in all Datapack compatible versions of MC Java, 1.16.x+ - 1.17 snapshots.

### How to Use:
Place a Blue Ice block on a Magma Block and it will create a Cryo-Bomb, the blast will turn nearby water/lava to its solid form.  
Standing to close may hurt.

(I just improved the pack for my purposes and made it multipurpose.)
