# [ðŸŽ¥Cryo-Bomb](https://youtu.be/pgQl1X-ksjs)  - Sister Pack [ThermiteðŸ”—](https://github.com/InfamousMusicify/Thermite)  
Cryo-Bomb, a Minecraft Data Pack.  Create a super cold blast!  Cool lava and freeze water!

#### Tested in 1.17.1
Works with all Datapack compatible versions of MC Java, 1.13 - 1.17.x

### How to Use:
Place a Blue Ice block on a Magma Block and it will create a Cryo-Bomb, the blast will turn nearby water/lava to its solid form.  
Place Packed Ice next to Magma to create a mini Cryo-Bomb! (turns lava to magma)  
Standing to close may hurt.

__1.13-1.15 version will turn lava to stone.
